About Me
Hello! I'm Marwan Almoghrabi, a 41-year-old Jordanian Blockchain Developer based in Jordan. I'm passionate about blockchain technology and decentralized systems. With a background in server management and programming, I'm currently building my own project called Blockchain Data Center (BDC), a data center dedicated to providing diverse services for blockchain networks, such as node hosting, decentralized storage, staking, and infrastructure support.
I'm employed full-time with a monthly salary of approximately $900, balancing my commitments of over $600 while pursuing this entrepreneurial venture. I plan to transition fully to BDC once it grows. Recently, I've been learning JavaScript and exploring projects like Filecoin, Nillion, and other DePIN networks to integrate into BDC.
My goal is to leverage my high-performance server to contribute to the blockchain ecosystem, foster partnerships, and achieve financial independence through innovative tech solutions.
Blockchain Data Center (BDC)
BDC is my personal project aimed at creating a reliable infrastructure for blockchain services in the Middle East, starting from Jordan. The center uses advanced hardware to offer:

Node hosting for networks like Ethereum, Solana, and emerging ones like Nillion.
Decentralized storage via IPFS/Filecoin.
Staking and delegation services.
Potential integrations with DePIN projects for distributed computing and privacy-focused computations.

I'm open to collaborations, partnerships, or contributions to expand BDC. If you're interested in blockchain infrastructure, feel free to reach out!
Server Specifications
My setup is powered by a robust server housed in a data center (DAMAMAX, Jordan), with monthly costs around $250. Here's the specs:

Model: HPE ProLiant DL380 Gen11
CPU: Intel Xeon Gold 6430 (32-Core)
RAM: 128GB (4 x 32GB) DDR5 PC5-4800B RDIMM
Storage: 4x HPE 3.84TB NVMe SSD
Controller: HPE MEGA RAID MR416i-o with cache battery
Network: Dual Port 10GB Base-T
Power Supply: 2x HPE Titanium 1800W
Fans: 6x High Performance Fans
OS: Windows Server 2025
Internet Speed: 1GB

This server is the foundation of BDC and is ready for blockchain experiments and services.
Recent Interests and Learning

Completed basics of JavaScript and planning to dive into Node.js, Web3.js, and Solidity.
Exploring projects like Filecoin for decentralized storage, Nillion for blind computation, and similar DePIN networks (e.g., Akash, Golem, Render).
Invested $750 in Somnia (SOMI) and monitoring its potential for staking/integration in BDC.
Participating in communities on Discord (e.g., Filecoin, Nillion) for guidance on becoming a Storage Provider or Node Operator.
