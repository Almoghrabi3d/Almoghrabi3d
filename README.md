👨‍💻 About Me

I am a Blockchain Developer specializing in designing and building decentralized applications (dApps) and their supporting infrastructure. I have experience in smart contract development, network security, and integrating Web2 technologies with the Web3 world.

My firm belief in blockchain's potential to revolutionize how we handle data and ownership drives me to contribute to building this future.

🚀 My Vision: A Blockchain Data Center in the Middle East

I am the founder and lead of an ambitious project to establish the first specialized Blockchain Data Center in Jordan, serving as a nucleus for a wider network in the Middle East.

Current Stage:
We have begun our journey by setting up and operating one High-Spec Server, which is the first step in building a robust and reliable infrastructure.

The Goal:
To provide hosting solutions, nodes, and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) specifically tailored to meet the demands of blockchain networks, developers, and startups in the region.
